## Why replies isn't arrive immediately

PinkTalk does not delivery itself to other when you create a story. It should be explored by pressed button from other. If you want to talk to other quickly Why don't you just reply to them?

## I can see duplicated user's stories

PinkTalk is totally random so it could be possible. When user come a lot. You  will be nice to meet again!
